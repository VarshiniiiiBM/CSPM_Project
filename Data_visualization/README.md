# Marble Accelerator Project - Data Visualization

This repository contains code for real-time visualization of Marble Accelerator data.  
The project has now been organized into two main parts:

- "PyQt_v1"
  Contains the PyQt-based plotting application for real-time charts in a desktop GUI.

- "Web_host_v2"
  Contains the FastAPI + WebSocket server for web-based visualization, along with its dependent HTML frontend files.

Other uploaded files outside these folders were part of the development process and represent intermediate stages of coding.
