# Marble Accelerator Project - Data Visualization

This repository contains code for real-time visualization of Marble Accelerator data.  
The project has now been organized into two main parts:

- "PyQt_v1"
  Contains the PyQt-based plotting application for real-time charts in a desktop GUI.

- "Web_host_v2"
  Contains the FastAPI + WebSocket server for web-based visualization, along with its dependent HTML frontend files.

- "cloud_host_v1"
  Contains the Azure-deployed cloud hosting setup for the web visualization server, including deployment configurations, files, and the local serial reader file.

Other uploaded files outside these folders were part of the development process and represent intermediate stages of coding.
