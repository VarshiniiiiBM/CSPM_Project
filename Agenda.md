*10.40 - 10.45 - Professor will provide idea about the next meeting

*10.45 - 11.00 - Discussion with Abhyshek about the doubts

*Abhyshek -  would like to know the specifics of the electromagnetic coil launcher. What kind of circuit was used for vertical launch, mosfets for timing and whether a capacitor would be necessary. Also the feasibility of launching about 1 metre.
