## Rules for writing equations, physical units and quantities

When formulating expressions, the internationally recognized rules of the SI system must be strictly adhered to. This applies to both presentation slides and reports. Failure to comply with these rules will result in a significant reduction in the grade for the formal criteria of the project work.

The SI-Brochure provides a good overview:
